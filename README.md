# darknet-mobilenet
The mobilenet model of Google's mobileNets in darknet framework. The official paper:
MobileNets: Efficient Convolutional Neural Networks for Mobile Vision Applications

I provide a cfg file of mobilenet and a pretrained mobilenet weights on ImageNet. 

This model achieved top-1 accuracy 71.1% and top-5 accuracy 90.5% (image size:448x448)
 
Note:
You want to use this model in darknet, you must wirte a group conv layer.
